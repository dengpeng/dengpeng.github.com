Being a fan of Jekyll and Bootstrap, it's kinda hard to resist trying
out the combination of them, when it's just made available and costs
basically not effort to setup. Great job, [JekllBootstrap][1]!

Maybe after stop blogging for two and a half years, I'll pick up it
again and put a note or two about my life, my code and my thougths
here. Let's see ... and hope I'm not going to be too lazy. :)
